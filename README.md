# Crime-Analysis-and-Prediction

The research question this project aims to tackle can be described as follows: 
              How to build a software framework to perform descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analysis of various crime data??
              
The objective of the project aims in analyzing and predicting the crime and crime hotspot spread in the city ofChicago, USA. There are various benefits of predicting something disastrous which will be going to happen in future so as to medicate the effect of its happening:

1. Help prevent recurring crimes in an area by tracking the patterns of crimes as well as
the most common types of crime in an area.
2. Early warning systems and constant vigilance through police patrolling can be
employed in hot spots of crime.
3. Consistency in record keeping, analyzing what type of force is needed, the number of
encounters and fatalities can be collected using crime forecasting.

In recent years, work has concentrated on qualitative predictions of a particular form case, such as riots or gun crimes. However, incidents such as crimes typically have complex associations with each other, and predictions of a particular form of case can not match the real demands. Hence, the model helps in predicting crime which thereby helps the Police to prevent its happening or take some action accordingly. Also, the model can easily be integrated to the Chicago Govt. Crime Department and this will help the police to arrange beats in those red zone areas so as to medicate its effect. The accuracy of the model is the biggest novelty to our problem statement.
